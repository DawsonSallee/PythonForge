Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command. You can use the “Copy” button (it appears in the upper-right corner when hovering over or tapping a code example), which strips prompts and omits output, to copy and paste the input lines into your interpreter. Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, # , and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples. Some examples:",

On the last line this is used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side are all evaluated first before any of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from the left to the right. The while loop executes as long as the condition (here: a < 10 ) remains true. In Python, like in C, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false. The test used in the example is a simple comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same as in C: < (less than), > (greater than), == (equal to), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to) and != (not equal to). The body of the loop is indented : indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount. The print() function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given. It differs from just writing the expression you want to write (as we did earlier in the calculator examples) in the way it handles multiple arguments, floating-point quantities, and strings. Strings are printed without quotes, and a space is inserted between items, so you can format things nicely, like this: >>> i = 256 * 256 >>> print ( 'The value of i is' , i ) The value of i is 65536 The keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with a different string: >>> a , b = 0 , 1 >>> while a < 1000 : ... print ( a , end = ',' ) ... a , b = b , a + b ... 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987, Footnotes [ 1 ] Since ** has higher precedence than - , -3**2 will be interpreted as -(3**2) and thus result in -9 . To avoid this and get 9 , you can use (-3)**2 . [ 2 ] Unlike other languages, special characters such as \\n have the same meaning with both single ( '...' ) and double ( \"...\" ) quotes. The only difference between the two is that within single quotes you don’t need to escape \" (but you have to escape \\' ) and vice versa.",

The name after * may also be _ , so (x, y, *_) matches a sequence of at least two items without binding the remaining items. Mapping patterns: {\"bandwidth \": b, \"latency \": l} captures the \"bandwidth \" and \"latency \" values from a dictionary. Unlike sequence patterns, extra keys are ignored. An unpacking like **rest is also supported. (But **_ would be redundant, so it is not allowed.)

The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables and variables of enclosing functions cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless, for global variables, named in a global statement, or, for variables of enclosing functions, named in a nonlocal statement), although they may be referenced. The actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the called function when it is called; thus, arguments are passed using call by value (where the value is always an object reference , not the value of the object). [ 1 ] When a function calls another function, or calls itself recursively, a new local symbol table is created for that call.

Parameter annotations are defined by a colon after the parameter name, followed by an expression evaluating to the value of the annotation. Return annotations are defined by a literal -> , followed by an expression, between the parameter list and the colon denoting the end of the def statement. The following example has a required argument, an optional argument, and the return value annotated:",
              "example": "def f ( ham str eggs str str print ( f __annotations__ print ( ham eggs return ham eggs f ( Annotations: {'ham ': <class 'str '>, 'return ': <class 'str '>, 'eggs ': <class 'str '>} Arguments: spam eggs"

              "concept": "Now that you are about to write longer, more complex pieces of Python, it is a good time to talk about coding style . Most languages can be written (or more concise, formatted ) in different styles; some are more readable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that. For Python, PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you: Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs. 4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out. Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters. This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays. Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions. When possible, put comments on a line of their own. Use docstrings. Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4) . Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use UpperCamelCase for classes and lowercase_with_underscores for functions and methods. Always use self as the name for the first method argument (see A First Look at Classes for more on classes and methods). Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case. Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain the code. Footnotes [ 1 ] Actually, call by object reference would be a better description, since if a mutable object is passed, the caller will see any changes the callee makes to it (items inserted into a list).",
