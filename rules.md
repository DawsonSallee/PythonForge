✦ Here is the Master Parser Blueprint, synthesizing all observations from the forensic analysis of the .rst files:

  Master Parser Blueprint

  This blueprint provides a definitive, step-by-step rulebook for the rst_parser.py script to accurately extract and organize learning units
  from the reStructuredText tutorial files.

  1. The Definitive Header & Hierarchy Rule:


   * Identification: A line is identified as a header if it is immediately followed by an underline of non-alphanumeric characters that is at
     least as long as the text of the header.
   * Valid Underline Styles: The following characters are recognized as valid header underlines, indicating different levels of hierarchy:
       * # (for top-level document titles, e.g., index.rst)
       * *
       * =
       * -
   * Hierarchy Management (`topic_hierarchy`): The topic_hierarchy list should be dynamically updated based on the detected header level. A
     new header resets or appends to the hierarchy based on its level relative to the previous header. The specific mapping of underline
     character to hierarchy level (e.g., # = Level 1, * = Level 2, = = Level 3, - = Level 4) should be consistently applied.

  2. The Definitive Code Block Identification Rule:

  A "Python code block" that we want to capture for learning units is identified by one of the following patterns:


   * Explicit Directives:
       * .. code-block:: python
       * .. code-block:: pycon
       * .. doctest::
   * Generic Literal Blocks:
       * :: (a double colon at the end of a paragraph, followed by an indented block)

  3. The Definitive Concept/Example Pairing Rule:


   * Buffering Text: All prose and non-code-block content encountered after a header and before a recognized Python code block should be
     buffered as "concept text."
   * Learning Unit Creation: When a valid Python code block (as defined in Rule 2) is encountered, the currently buffered "concept text" (if
     any) should be paired with this code block to form a "Learning Unit."
   * Resetting Buffer: After a Learning Unit is formed, the concept text buffer should be cleared.
   * Code Block Context: Code blocks appearing immediately after a header should be considered directly related to that header's topic.


  4. Comprehensive List of Exclusion & Cleaning Rules:

  The following patterns, directives, and text should be ignored, removed, or cleaned from the extracted content to ensure a clean and
  focused "Learning Unit":


   * reStructuredText Directives (remove the directive and its content):
       * .. rubric:: Footnotes
       * .. testsetup::
       * .. sectionauthor::
       * .. only:: html
       * .. warning::
       * .. toctree::
       * .. Tip::
       * .. code-block:: none (and its content, as it represents output)
       * .. code-block:: console (and its content, as it represents shell commands/output)
       * .. code-block:: shell-session (and its content, as it represents shell commands/output)
       * .. code-block:: text (and its content, as it represents non-Python text/output)
   * Text Patterns (remove or clean from lines):
       * Python Prompts: Remove >>>  and ...  from the beginning of lines within code blocks.
       * Shell Prompts: Remove $ and (tutorial-env) $ from the beginning of lines within code blocks.
       * Comments: Remove lines starting with # (unless it's part of a doctest example where the comment is the expected output, in which case
         it should be handled by the doctest parser).
       * Tracebacks and Error Messages: Remove lines associated with Python tracebacks and error outputs (e.g., Traceback (most recent call
         last):, File "<stdin>", line X, in <module>, SyntaxError: ..., TypeError: ..., NameError: ..., ZeroDivisionError: ..., KeyError: ...,
         StopIteration, FileNotFoundError: ..., ConnectionError: ..., RuntimeError: ..., KeyboardInterrupt).
       * Blank Lines from Output: Remove <BLANKLINE> markers.
       * Substitution Markers: Remove |...| (e.g., |usr_local_bin_python_x_dot_y_literal|).
       * Internal/Development Comments: Remove XXX comments.
       * External URLs: Remove or sanitize URLs (e.g., https://..., http://...) if they appear within code blocks or prose where they are not
         part of the core concept.
       * Specific Code Comments/Headers: Remove specific patterns like # File demo.py.
       * Output Separators: Remove lines like --- or ---------------------------------------- that are used to separate output sections.
       * Ellipsis: Remove ... when it signifies omitted code or output (e.g., in pprint or traceback examples).
       * Docstring formatting: Remove leading whitespace from docstrings based on the reStructuredText convention.
       * Footnote references: Remove [#]_ and [#] from prose.
